Vanillity is my test fork of Nukkit 1.16.100.

I wanna try to add some things from java like generation, health regen or something</br>
To build just run
```
git submodule update --init
chmod +x mvnw
mvnw clean package
```
Output will be in /target folder, named vanillity-1.0.jar

## Why 1.16.100?
Bedrock is so bad in 1.16.200+, literally unplayable, maybe will update in future
